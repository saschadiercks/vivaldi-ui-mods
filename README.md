### Highlighting of Background-audio in inactive tabs
It also supports highlighting of background-audio, if the audio is not playing in the active tab:

## Custom Icon macOS
There is also a custom icon for macOS, you can apply to Vivaldi, in cas you want a slightly cleaner lookin icon.
The icon is taken from:
https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datei:Vivaldi_web_browser_logo.svg

I then scale it up a bit, so that it matches the other macOS-Icons (in size and shape).

### How to apply the icon
1. Find Vivaldi in the _Applications-folder_ in the finder
2. right-click, the Vivald.app and slect _Informations_
3. Drage the icon over to the icon in the upper left area of the new window.
4. restart Vivaldi and the new icon is applied.

If you want to remove that icon again, simply follow the preocedure from above, but instead of adding a new icon, just delete it.
