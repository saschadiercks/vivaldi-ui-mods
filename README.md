## How to apply a UI-mod
1. Visit [vivaldi://experiments](vivaldi://experiments) and tick the "Allow for CSS modifications" box.
2. Then go to: [vivaldi://settings/appearance/](vivaldi://settings/appearance/) and choose a folder to load from. (Place the new CSS there or choose the folder, where you cloned the repository to.)
